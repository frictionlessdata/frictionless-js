We then determine the trend value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in the trend column. Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months. The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle value and the trend value for the missing month."

The last one or two years listed could have preliminary uncertainties set equal to the average uncertainty since 1980. Before 1980 the global growth rate has been approximated by taking the average of Mauna Loa and the South Pole, correcting for the offset between (MLO+SPO)/2 and the global Marine Boundary Layer, as described in Ballantyne et al, 2012."
